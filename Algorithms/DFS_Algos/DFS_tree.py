# Problem 2
'''
a)
The E's start_time is after B's and E's end_time is after B's

b)
The start/end_times of T_E are all before the stard/end_times of T_D

c)
E can be connected to B, A, and any other vertex in T_E.
For v in T_E, it can be connected by a back edge to any vertex
lying on the path connecting v and A.

# Problem 4

'''
Algorithm:
Traverse through tree using regular DFS algorithm,
if there is a back edge, then there is is a cycle.

Proof:
Let v be the number of vertices in G. If there is a
back edge, then there are at least v edges in G,
therefore, there must be a cycle in G.
